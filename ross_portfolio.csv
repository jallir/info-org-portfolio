The artist enjoys this piece because she sees the picture clearly but discovers that others do not.

Created in her final semester of undergrad and after many drawing classes, the artist had many large pieces of paper with life drawings, sketches, etc. In knowing that all this paper was going to sit in her parent's basement she decided to fold it and sew it together and then paste other smaller sketches into it as well. And then to make it less precious, she dunked the entire thing in her bathtub full of coffee. Which in retrospect was a terrible idea but the artist has learned many new things since then. This piece is less about being artwork and more about being an exercise in letting go and allowing things to change and ""be ruined.""",,"Springfield, MA","Ross, Jenna",B011-1223,"2,658,982 bytes",5/13/2023,"Ross, Jenna",copyright J.Ross2023
